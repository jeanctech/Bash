## Introduction

Bash is a command interpreter, which means it is a program that allows users
Interact with the computer by typing commands. Bash is the default system shell
Gnu (Linux) and Apple's Os X operating system, and is compatible with Posix 1003.2. Bash is also a language
scriptable, meaning that commands can be grouped into a script
that runs a shell program. Bash scripts are a great way to automate
different types of tasks in a system and support variables, conditional statements and loops as well
than programming languages. Some of the applications of Bash Scripts include manipulating
files, the execution of routine tasks such as backup operations and automation. Bash is used
widely in the Gnu/Linux operating system and is used as the default login shell for
most Linux distributions.

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial objective of the project. And then I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think which for the moment can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.
As soon as the course continues I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
